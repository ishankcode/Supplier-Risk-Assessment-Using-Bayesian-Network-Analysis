# Supplier-Risk-Assessment-Using-Bayesian-Network-Analysis

Explored, and analyzed various factors that generally impact production delays. Based on our dataset as well as our experience we Identified that supplier delivery (Basically Supplier's Inability to meet the demands on time) is one of the biggest factor.
 
<ins>What is Suppler Evaluation ? </ins >
Supplier evaluation means a formal assessment of suppliers to measure their performance against various criteria and determine if they meet the organizational needs. The objective is to create a best-in-class and low-risk portfolio of available suppliers for use.
 
<ins> General Process</ins>
1. The supplier evaluation process starts with evaluating your company's needs and developing the list of requirements 
2. Design a selection criterion to evaluate the suppliers.
3. Request for information or RFI is sent to suppliers to get more information about them. The RFI aims to know if the company is interested and gather enough information to make a rough evaluation.
4. Once the bids or RFIs are received, the suppliers are evaluated.
  
<ins>Goal of the project</ins>
To develop a new approach to supplier risk assessment and evaluation based on Bayesian Network. <br />

Paper2: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220672227_Modeling_Supplier_Risks_Using_Bayesian_Networks <br />

Used AgenaRisk to develop 2 Bayseian Networks:  <br />
1) Supplier Risk Analysis: To understand the supplier risk focus on 3 factors:
    - Network Risk: Misalignment of Interest, Financial Risk, Leadership change, Tier-2 stoppage
    - Operational Risk: Quality problems, Delivery Problems
    - External Risk: Supplier Locked, Disaster(Out of control Event) 
2) Supplier Evaluation tool: Focusing on 3 main factors:
     - Primary Criteria: Multiple factors such as Demand, purchase cost, technical support, etc.
     - Green Criteria: Distance from supplier, Transportation modes, Total C02 emission
     - Resiliency Criteria: Restorative capacity, Adaptive, and Absorptive capacity.

Using this model Identified the best supplier as per the company's requirements.
